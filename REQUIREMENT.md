# Requirement

I am building a demo website that search the receipt for cocktail. It contains two pages: a landing page and a receipt info page.

The landing page contains a some information about cocktail. A chat function that connects with ChatGPT API, and a search function that search for cocktail receipt.

The receipt info page contains the ingrident, steps, images for the cocktail. There is a translate function that translate the receipt to other language.

You should build the website with React and Tailwind CSS. We don't need backend.

During the implementation, you will use tree main API sources:

1. CocktailDB API: It contains the ingridient, steps, and images for cocktail. You will need to use it to get info about cocktail.
2. DeepL Api: You will use it for translating receipt.
3. ChatGPT api: You will need to use it to chat.
